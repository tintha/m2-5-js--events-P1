# Fundamentals: Variable shadowing

---

We've talked a bit about how variables have scope…

---

### Inside the house

```js
let backyard = ["Abraham", "Cindy", "BZZT-ROBOT-3000"];

const house = () => {
  let caretaker = "Beatrice";

  // `caretaker` is in the house, but they can still see the backyard.
  console.log(backyard); // works!
};

// In the backyard, we can't see into the house. Too bright outside!
console.log(caretaker); // error
```

---

You can always "look out" from within a scope.

You can never "look in".

---

A scope is formed by:

- Functions -`if` / `else`

If you see squiggly brackets _other_ than an object (`let hi = {}`), it's a scope.

# Breakout Exercises

---

### Exercise 1:

```js
let isHungry = true;
let fruit = "watermelon";

if (isHungry) {
  // Switch to a more filling melon
  let fruit = "cantaloupe";
}

// What is the value of `fruit`?
console.log(fruit);
```

---

### Exercise 2:

```js
let roomTemperature = 21;

function turnOnHeater() {
  roomTemperature = 24;
}

// What is the value of `roomTemperature`?
console.log(roomTemperature);
```

---

### Exercise 3:

```js
let mood = "😪";

function watchTelevision() {
  let show = "Tiger King";
  mood = ["😳", "🤢", "🥴"];
}

if (mood === "😪") {
  watchTelevision();
}

// What is the value of `mood`?
console.log(mood);
```

---

### Exercise 4:

```js
let recipe = [
  "crack eggs into bowl",
  "beat eggs until velvety",
  "add salt & pepper to taste",
  "combine with flour",
  "bake until dough has leavened",
];

bake();

function bake(recipe) {
  // What is the value of `recipe`?
  console.log(recipe);
}
```

---

# Variable rules

---

### Variables can be reassigned from within child scopes

```js
let hi = 5;

if (true) {
  // Reassign the parent variable to `10`
  hi = 10;
}
```

---

### Variables can be "shadowed" in child scopes

```js
let hi = 5;

if (true) {
  // Create a new variable named hi.
  // DOES NOT affect the `hi` in the parent scope.
  let hi = 10;
}

console.log(hi); // 5
```

---

### Variables can be shadowed in function parameters

```js
let hi = 5;

function sayHi(hi) {
  return hi;
}

console.log(sayHi()); // undefined
console.log(sayHi(hi)); // 5
console.log(sayHi("greetings")); // 'greetings'
```
